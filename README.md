# Obfuscator
This is a hexadecimal obfuscator handmade by me.

I used https://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx to encode my source_code to the point of no return. 

If you try to decode the hex it will result in weird characters.. 

You don't have to credit me but it is appreciated.

# How to Run
**Normal Obfuscating:**
1. Run main.py and input your source code.
2. Get the result from it.
3. Get the template from obfuscate_run.py and input your encoded source code into line 5 where it says your_code.
4. Run it and your done!

**Mega Secure Obfuscating:**

1. Go to: https://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx.
6. Encode the whole script including the template.
7. Put the result in another template.
8. Copy the entire script AGAIN including the template.
9. Encode the entire script again.
10. Paste the result into another template.
11. Repeat as necessary
