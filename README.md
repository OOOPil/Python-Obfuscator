# Obfuscator
This is a hexadecimal obfuscator handmade by me.

I used https://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx to encode my source_code to the point of no return. 

If you try to decode the hex it will result in weird characters.. 

You don't have to credit me but it is appreciated.

# How to Run
1. Run main.py and input your source code.
2. Get the result from it.
3. Get the template from obfuscate_run.py and input your encoded source code into line 5 where it says your_code.
4. Run it and your done!
